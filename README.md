# WindowsBloatwareRemover
A tool that allows for removal of all Preinstalled Apps on Windows that can't be removed by Windows, such as Microsoft Edge

## How to use
Download the executable of the ![latest releases](https://github.com/J-onasJones/WindowsBloatwareRemover/releases/latest) and run it as administrator.
To do that locate your download folder, right-click the file and click "Run as Administrator"
Windows probably won't run it at first but display a prompt that it "protected" your pc by blocking it. Click on "More Info" and then on "Run Anyway".

Now follow the instructions in the terminal.
**As of version 1.0.0 a proper UI replaces the terminal.**

## Why
Ever used Windows? - I don't think this needs more explanation, especially for 10 and 11.

For everyone else: Microsoft is a master when it comes to slapping bloatware onto their operating system, the edge browser being the most prominent one.
